This course teaches you how to analyze continuous response data and discrete count data. Linear regression, Poisson regression, negative binomial regression, gamma regression, analysis of variance, linear regression with indicator variables, analysis of covariance, and mixed models ANOVA are presented in the course

Regression

    building and evaluating polynomial regression models using PROC GLMSELECT and PROC REG
    dealing with violations of model assumptions and multicollinearity 

Analysis of Variance

    performing n-way ANOVA
    interpreting significant interactions
    writing LSMESTIMATE statements
    performing evaluation of model assumptions and remedial measures 

Regression Using Indicator Variables and Analysis of Covariance

    building and interpreting analysis of covariance models using the GLM procedure
    least squares means from an ANCOVA model
    diagnostics and remedial measures for ANCOVA models 

Generalized Linear Models

    using the GENMOD procedure to fit Poisson and negative binomial regression models
    using the GLIMMIX procedure to fit gamma regression models 

Linear Mixed Models

    performing linear mixed model analysis with PROC GLIMMIX
