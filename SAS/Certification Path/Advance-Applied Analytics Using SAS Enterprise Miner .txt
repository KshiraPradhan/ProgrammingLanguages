This course is appropriate for SAS Enterprise Miner from release 5.3 up to 14.1. The course covers the skills that are required to assemble analysis flow diagrams using the rich tool set of SAS Enterprise Miner for both pattern discovery (segmentation, association, and sequence analyses) and predictive modeling (decision tree, regression, and neural network models).
