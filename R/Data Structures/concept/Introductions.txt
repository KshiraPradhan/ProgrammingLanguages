What is Data Structures
===============
-In Computer science , data structures is a way of organizing data in computer so it can be used efficiently
-In general it is based of a computer to fetch and store data at any place in its memory pointer.


Student datasets
================

studentID	AdminDate	studentName	age	class	Performance
1		10/15/2015	ganesh		12	Class1	status
2		11/16/2015	star		13	Class2	Weak
3		12/13/2015	hari		15	Class3	Good
4		14/12/2015	gana		17	Class4	Excellent

Datasets
========
-A data sets is usually a rectangular arrays of data with rows representing obserations and columns representing variables.
-Different traditions have different names for the rows and columsn in datasets
	-Statistics refers has observations and variables
	-Data analysts call them records and fields
	-data-mining and macine-learning roles refers them as examples and attributes.
-We can distinguish between the structures of the datasets and the conents or data types 
	-StudentID is a row or case identifier
	-admdate is a data variable
	-age is continous variable
	-class is a nominal values
	-performance is an ordinal variable.
	


DataTypes or Mode
================
-R can hanlde include numeric,character,logical(TRUE/FALSE), complex(imaginary numbers and raw(Bytes).
-In the above student dataset
	-StudentID,age,admindate is a numeric variable
	-class,perforamance,student name is a character variable
Similarly we need to tell to R that
	-student ID is a case identifier,admindate contains date,class& performance are nominal and ordinal variables
-R refers to case identifiers as row names and categorical variables (nominal,ordinal) as factors.
